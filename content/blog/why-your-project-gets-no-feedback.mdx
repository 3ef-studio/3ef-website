summary: "Silence is not rejection. It is usually a design problem in how we ask for feedback, not a verdict on the work itself."

Most independent projects do not fail loudly.
They ship. They work. They even get a few likes.
And then they sit there.

No comments. No emails. No real feedback.

If this sounds familiar, it does not mean your project is bad. It usually means something else is happening.

## Silence Is Not Rejection

When people do not respond, our instinct is to assume disinterest.
But in practice, silence is often a signal of *uncertainty*, not judgment.

The reader might think:

* “This looks finished. What could I add?”
* “I’m not sure what kind of feedback they want.”
* “This seems personal. I do not want to criticize it.”

In other words, the project may be fine. The invitation is unclear.

## Why Feedback Rarely Shows Up

After watching this pattern play out repeatedly across independent projects, three causes show up again and again.

### 1. There Is No Obvious Question

Many build-in-public posts describe what was built, how it works, and what was learned.
They do not ask for anything.
Without a clear question, readers default to passive approval. A like is easy. A comment requires direction.

### 2. The Stakes Are Invisible

People are more likely to engage when they understand what is at risk.
If the project feels like a personal experiment with no clear next step, readers hesitate to weigh in.
They are not sure whether their opinion matters or could actually influence the outcome.

### 3. The Reader Has No Role

Most posts are written from the builder’s perspective only.
The reader does not know who they are supposed to be in the story:

* A potential user?
* A peer reviewer?
* Someone who has failed before and can warn you?

When the role is unclear, participation drops.

## Designing for Response, Not Validation

Getting feedback is not about being louder or posting more often.
It is about reducing the cognitive effort required to respond.

A few practical shifts help:

* Ask one specific question, not five
* Frame the decision you are struggling with
* Make it clear how feedback could change what you build next

You are not asking people to judge your work. You are inviting them into a decision.

## What I Am Changing Going Forward

I am still building the same things.
But instead of posting finished explanations, I am experimenting with:

* Sharing work before it feels complete
* Calling out the exact uncertainty I am stuck on
* Writing posts that are easier to reply to than to like

If nothing else, silence has been a useful signal.
Not about quality, but about clarity.

## A Question for You

If you have built an independent project that worked but got no real feedback, what actually helped turn that around?

And if nothing ever did, what do you think was missing?
